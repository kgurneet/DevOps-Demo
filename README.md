**CI/CD Pipeline Demo
**
This project is a demo website showcasing an automated CI/CD pipeline. It highlights how DevOps practices improve release efficiency, reliability, and deployment workflows.

**Features**

GitHub Triggers: Automatically builds and tests code on every push.

Containerized Builds: Uses Docker to ensure consistent environments across development and production.

AWS Deployment: Seamlessly deploys containerized applications to AWS.

Automated Workflow: Reduces manual effort, increases release speed, and improves reliability.

**Tech Stack**

1. GitHub Actions
2. Docker
3. AWS (ECS / ECR / S3 depending on setup)
4. Node.js / HTML / CSS (frontend demo)

**How It Works**

1. Push code to GitHub â†’ triggers pipeline.
2. Pipeline builds Docker image and runs tests.
3. If successful, image is pushed to AWS ECR.
4. Application is deployed to AWS ECS (or other service).
